# Detecting_Fish_Diseases_using_ML
The detection of fish diseases and their causes is a necessary step to prevent from spreading disease.
In this work, we want to find out the salmon fish disease in aquaculture, since Salmon aquaculture is the fastest-growing food production system globally, accounting for 70 percent of the market. 
And it is also easy to specify and differentiate salmon fish when compared to other fishes. 
Being motivated by the recent successes in the alliance of flawless machine learning techniques, we can identify the fish diseases caused by the various pathogen bacteria.
A dataset was prepared with approximately 2000 water samples collected from different places for training the model. 
Before training, the data was preprocessed and all the necessary information is preprocessed. According to medical sciences, we have found the probable diseases and suggestions depending on the water quality range. 
The study highlights the potential of technology-driven solutions in addressing challenges related to fish disease detection in aquaculture.
By machine learning, this project offers a robust framework for early identification and management of fish diseases, thereby enhancing food security and sustainability in aquaculture operations.
The experimental results shown high accuracy in detecting fish diseases specific to water quality based on the algorithm with real datasets. 
The application was successful on different datasets from all over the world. The overall system has shown promising performance with 97% accuracy.
